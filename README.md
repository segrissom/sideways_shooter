I created this as my answer to the Python Crash Course Chapter 12, exercise 5
The task was to create a game where you place a ship on the left side of the screen. The ship doesn't move right or left, but up and down. 
The ship should fire bullets which are deleted once they disappear off the screen.

I decided to make mine a cowboy which I hand drew in paint.
